# About Me  

Hi, my name is **Kelvin R. Tobias**, and Iâ€™m currently a student at **Western Governors University**, pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in **Software Engineering**. My curriculum has provided me with the opportunity to learn **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **C#**.  

I build a lot of projects in my free time to reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned. As you know, itâ€™s hard to remember the syntax for so many languages, so building projects helps solidify my knowledge and skills.  

Below is a list of **Java projects** I created outside my curriculum to help me prepare for my **Java Objective Assessment**. These projects not only helped me practice Java but also gave me real-world experience with problem-solving, design, and implementation.
